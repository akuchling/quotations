      Perhaps the reader may ask, of what consequence is it whether
the author's exact language is preserved or not, provided we have his
thought? The answer is, that inaccurate quotation is a sin against
truth. It may appear in any particular instance to be a trifle, but
perfection consists in small things, and perfection is no trifle.

      In reality, though, the first thing to ask of history is that it
should point out to us the paths of liberty. The great lesson to draw
from revolutions is not that they devour humanity but rather that
tyranny never fails to generate them.

      "I cannot endure doing nothing," [Charles Darwin] told Jenyns in
1877. It was almost as if he feared the moment when his mind might be
empty, when his work might be done; and to stave off this abyss
constantly found old and new topics to pursue. If not dread of
idleness, then dread of decrepitude. He often said that his work made
him feel alive, helped his mind sing, was the one thing that blotted
out his cares. Although he called himself "a kind of machine for
grinding out general laws out of a large collection of facts," the
truth was he only felt himself when immersed in some demanding new
project.

      He did not mean to be cruel. If anybody had called him so, he
would have resented it extremely. He would have said that what he did
was done entirely for the good of the country. But he was a man who
had always been accustomed to consider himself first and foremost,
believing that whatever he wanted was sure to be right, and therefore
he ought to have it. So he tried to get it, and got it too, as people
like him very often do. Whether they enjoy it when they have it is
another question.

      "Non-fiction", on the other hand, declares itself to be the
carrier of fact, an expression of reality, and thus of truth. Why then
does most fact-based work have a remarkably short shelf life? The
reply might be that additional facts come along. That we are learning
all the time. In that case, it was never an expression of reality or
truth. And even if the facts are overtaken, the arguments built upon
them should not date with such terrifying rapidity. Decade-old serious
"non-fiction" often seems arcane, irrelevant. The written style itself
seems to become old-fashioned. Two-centuries-old decent "fiction" on
the other hand can easily remain fresh.

      Government, today, is growing too strong to be safe. There are
no longer any citizens in the world; there are only subjects. They
work day in and day out for their masters; they are bound to die for
their masters at call. Out of this working and dying they tend to get

    <p>
      I am a design chauvinist. I believe that good design is magical
and not to be lightly tinkered with. The difference between a great
design and a lousy one is in the meshing of the thousand details that
either fit or don't, and the spirit of the passionate intellect that
has tied them together, or tried. That's why programming -- or buying
software -- on the basis of "lists of features" is a doomed and
misguided effort. The features can be thrown together, as in a garbage
can, or carefully laid together and interwoven in elegant unification,
as in APL, or the Forth language, or the game of chess.

      If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school

      Yes, Agassiz <em>does</em> recommend authors to eat fish,
because the phosphorus in it makes brain. So far you are correct. But
I cannot help you to a decision about the amount you need to eat -- at
least, not with certainty. If the specimen composition you send is
about your fair usual average, I should judge that a couple of whales
would be all you would want for the present. Not the largest kind, but
simply good middling-sized whales.

      Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket
fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and

arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its
laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.
This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds
of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.

      The more I have studied him, the more Newton has receded from
me. It has been my privilege at various times to know a number of
brilliant men, men whom I acknowledge without hesitation to be my
intellectual superiors. I have never, however, met one against whom I
was unwilling to measure myself, so that it seemed reasonable to say
that I was half as able as the person in question, or a third or a
fourth, but in every case a finite fraction. The end result of my
study of Newton has served to convince me that with him there is no
measure. He has become for me wholly other, one of the tiny handful of
supreme geniuses who have shaped the categories of the human
intellect, a man not finally reducible to the criteria by which we
comprehend our fellow beings.

desire the ambiguous and paradoxical. It is sickness of the
profoundest kind to believe that there is one reality. There is
sickness in any piece of work or any piece of art seriously attempting
to suggest that the idea that there is more than one reality is
somehow redundant.

      There is something about a mass-market Luxury Cruise that's
unbearably sad. Like most unbearably sad things, it seems incredibly
elusive and complex in its causes and simple in its effect: on board
the <foreign>Nadir</foreign> -- especially at night, when all the
ship's structured fun and reassurances and gaiety-noise ceased -- I
felt despair. The word's overused and banalified now,
<em>despair</em>, but it's a serious word, and I'm using it seriously.
For me it denotes a simple admixture -- a weird yearning for death
combined with a crushing sense of my own smallness and futility that
presents as a fear of death. It's maybe close to what people call
dread or angst. But it's not these things, quite. It's more like
wanting to die in order to escape the unbearable feeling of becoming
aware that I'm small and weak and selfish and going without any doubt
at all to die. It's wanting to jump overboard.

structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of
death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally.
Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, Church's Undecidability Theorem,
Turing's Halting Theorem, Tarski's Truth Theorem -- all have the

experimentation that it is carried out with limited resources, and an

      There was a blithe certainty that came from first comprehending
the full Einstein field equations, arabesques of Greek letters
clinging tenuously to the page, a gossamer web. They seemed
insubstantial when you first saw them, a string of squiggles. Yet to
follow the delicate tensors as they contracted, as the superscripts
paired with subscripts, collapsing mathematically into concrete
classical entities -- potential; mass; forces vectoring in a curved
geometry -- that was a sublime experience. The iron fist of the real,
inside the velvet glove of airy mathematics.

      For me, it's just a normal artistic endeavour to explore the
dark side. Certainly, I'm not alone in it. Artists generally don't
like to accept the version of reality that society and culture hand
them. They want to know what's really going on. So you're always
looking in the ceilings, under the floorboards and behind the walls,
trying to find the mechanisms, the structures, and the truth. I find
that often leads you into some dark places.

are focusing our whole crypto policy on catching child pornographers.
If you think that cryptography is good for society you have to
apologize and say that you are against child pornography... The fact
that I even have to say that is an indication of how effective this
Red-baiting is... I think that we can't let our civil liberties for

      The true poet and the true scientist are not estranged. They go
forth into nature like two friends. Behold them strolling through the
summer fields and woods. The younger of the two is much the more
active and inquiring; he is ever and anon stepping aside to examine
some object more minutely, plucking a flower, treasuring a shell,
pursuing a bird, watching a butterfly; now he turns over a stone,
peers into the marshes, chips off a fragment of rock, and everywhere
seems intent on some special and particular knowledge of the things
about him. The elder man has more an air of leisurely contemplation
and enjoyment, is less curious about special objects and features, and
more desirous of putting himself in harmony with the spirit of the
whole. But when his younger companion has any fresh and characteristic
bit of information to impart to him, how attentively he listens, how
sure and discriminating is his appreciation! The interests of the two
in the universe are widely different, yet in no true sense are they
hostile or mutually destructive.

developing taste were sensitivity and intelligence. I don't think this
is so; I'd rather call them curiosity and courage. Curiosity to look
for the new and the hidden; courage to develop your own tastes
regardless of what others might say or think.

      This is an essential element of the business of being a man: to
flood everyone around you in a great radiant arc of bullshit, one
whose source and object of greatest intensity is yourself. To behave
as if you have everything firmly under control even when you have just
sailed your boat over the falls. "To keep your head," wrote Rudyard
Kipling in his classic poem "If", which articulated the code of
high-Victorian masculinity in whose fragmentary shadow American men
still come of age, "when all about you are losing theirs"; but in
reality, the trick of being a man is to give the appearance of keeping
your head when, deep inside, the truest part of you is crying out, Oh,
shit!

      I loathe the expression "What makes him tick." It is the
American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the
foolish expression. A person not only ticks, he also chimes and
strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again,
and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm.

      The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant. This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

illusions of past and future, of progression, of their opening births

      Everything you've learned in school as "obvious" becomes less
and less obvious as you begin to study the universe. For example,
there are no solids in the universe. There's not even a suggestion of
a solid. There are no absolute continuums. There are no surfaces.
There are no straight lines.

I have had cats and I was fond of them, fonder than they ever were of
me. But what I want is unconditional love, and therefore I want a
dog. I want to make its life a joy.  I want to scratch behind its
ears, and scratch its belly when it rolls over.  I want to gently
extend its tail so the dog can tell it has a fine tail indeed. I want
to give it a shampoo, and sneak it bites from the table, and let it
exchange the news with other dogs we meet on the street.  I want it to
bark at the doorbell, be joyous to see my loved ones, shake hands, and
look concerned if I seem depressed.  If I throw a ball I want the dog
to bring back the ball and ask me to throw it again.

the most intricate and complex of man's handiworks. The management of

liberal doses of common sense, and a God-given humility to recognize

  Dazzled by our own creations, we have forgotten that we are wholly
  embedded in a much older, more powerful world whose constancy we
  take for granted.  As a species, we are much less flexible than we
  would like to believe, vulnerable to economic loss and prone to
  social unrest when nature -- in the guise of Katrina, Sandy, or
  Harvey, among others -- diverges just a little from what we expect.
  Averse to even the smallest changes, we have now set the stage for
  environmental deviations that will be larger and less predictable
  than any we have faced before.  The great irony of the Anthropocene
  is that our outsized effects on the planet have in fact put Nature
  firmly back in charge, with a still-unpublished set of rules we will
  simply have to guess at.  The fossil record of previous planetary
  upheavals makes it clear that there may be a long period of
  biogeochemical capriciousness before a new, stable regime emerges.

that there were almost no emendations, perhaps one or two crossed-out
words on a page. Page after page, perhaps eight hundred pages in all,
this is what makes a book, this is where genius goes, what he does,
what a privilege to be in his presence, to touch, to see, to read him
as he writes. I wished I had a class to share this with, or Dr. V,
because here on this very page, in Trollope's own hand, was Miss
MacKenzie her own self sighing into the mirror over her advancing age,
then moving forward to kiss her very own reflection. It would not do,
would not do at all, for tears to stain these pages, so I wiped my
eyes on my sleeve, yucky by now, and bowed my head over the words as I
turned page after page upon page. There are churches of all kinds;

computer science seems to be taught, students would not see equational
statements of Newton's Laws until their first semester of graduate

    <p>
      If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all
others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power
called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as
he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces
itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
dispossess himself of it... He who receives an idea from me, receives
instructions himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his
taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should
be spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual
instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have
been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature...

      Institutions feel no pain. Only people can feel the relentless
pain of illiteracy, the desperate bafflement of a mind unskilled in
the ways of logic and thoughtful attention, and dimly aware, but aware
nevertheless, of its own confusion. Schools do not have minds; they
have guidelines. Their guidelines run, when it isn't too inconvenient,
as far as what they are not at all ashamed to call the parameters of
basic minimum competency. Basic minimum competence (why <em>do</em>
they need that <em>y</em>?) is not literacy. It is, however, just
enough a counterfeit literacy to convince the minimally competent to
fancy themselves literate, except, of course, for those moments of
desperate pain.

      This is probably true in today's market, if you just grafted in
some free software. However, we are also talking about how a market
would work where software does not need to be rewritten and reinvented
literally thousands of times because people don't have any choice.
Perhaps the software that would be written would finally be more
useful than add-on cruft for MS-DOS or lousy "applets" for Netscape or
the umpteenth bad implementation of some marginally useful class for
C++. e.g., I don't think "good enough" would be workable in a world of
predominantly free software. The unfree code (it won't go away any
time soon) would also be held up to much higher standards than is done
today.

marketers discover that the reason low-income Southern women were the
heaviest users of roach spray was that "a lot of their feelings about
the roach were very similar to the feelings that they had about the
men in their lives," said the advertising executive on the account.
They said the roach, like the man in their life, "only comes around
when he wants food." The act of spraying roaches and seeing them die

often covering no more than the last ten years. Cutting off the past
in this way streamlines the search. But a musing cut off from

      To create a community of radical scholars, men and women who
recognize that rules and social conventions are arbitrary, but have
mastered them nonetheless -- a community which shares such a scorn and
disrespect for the present society that it can embrace the whole
bundle of rules and subvert them thereby -- that should be our goal.

      One such utopian dream was Charles Ives's Universe Symphony.
This was a work with hundreds or thousands of participants, spread out
across the valleys, on hillsides and on mountaintops. It was to be so
gigantic, so inclusive that no single individual could ever assume
mastery or control of it. Anyone who wished to do so could add to it.
It was only an idea then, but one which excites our imagination
enormously. To imagine ourselves as participants in a Universe
Symphony is to give more critical attention to our performance than is
the case if we merely consider ourselves to be in a dumpyard. We
analyze and criticize the music better; we recognize the soloists, the
conductors, the prima donnas; we listen to the talents and faults of
each.

      At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the
amount of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society
permits more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is
to function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously
deal with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we
accord our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching
light of comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humour it is
clearly of value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from
laughter are claiming special privileges which should not be granted.

      ... one ought to recognize that the present political chaos is
connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring
about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify
your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You
cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid
remark, its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political
language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties,
from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound
truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity
to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at
least change one's own habits, and from time to time, one can even, if
one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some
<em>jackboot</em>, <em>Achilles' heel</em>, <em>hotbed</em>,
<em>melting pot</em>, <em>acid test</em>, <em>veritable inferno</em>
or other lump of verbal refuse -- into the dustbin where it belongs.

      In all such cases there is one common circumstance -- the system
has a quantity of potential energy, which is capable of being
transformed into motion, but which cannot begin to be so transformed
till the system has reached a certain configuration, to attain which
requires an expenditure of work, which in certain cases may be
infinitesimally small, and in general bears no definite proportion to
the energy developed in consequence thereof. For example, the rock
loosed by frost and balanced on a singular point of the mountain side,
the little spark which kindles the great forest, the little word which
sets the world a-fighting, the little scruple which prevents a man
from doing his will, the little spore which blights all the potatoes,
the little gemmule which makes us philosophers or idiots. Every
existence above a certain rank has its singular points: the higher the
rank the more of them. At these points, influences whose physical
magnitude is too small to be taken account of by a finite being, may
produce results of the greatest importance.

      Imaginative literature in the service of rebellion, or satanism,
quickly sinks into exhibitionism or obscurity. Imaginative literature
as the expression of a deeply apprehended truth, poetry which
interprets to a man the myth of his own age, can in the hands of
Dante, of Shakespeare, of Cervantes, of Camoes and of Goethe, help to
raise the level of a whole civilization.

      There is a tendency among some Pagans to want to be back in, let
us say, sixth-century Wales instead of wanting a <em>transformed</em>
world. Going back to sixth-century Wales is a fantasy that is dear to
me. It's part of the archetypal dream. But that is all it is. Nobody
really wants to go back into the past except a bunch of space cookies.

      The aim of this article has been to show that our most
successful theories in physics are those that explicitly leave room
for the unknown, while confining this room sufficiently to make the
theory empirically disprovable. It does not matter whether this room
is created by allowing for arbitrary forces as Newtonian dynamics
does, or by allowing for arbitrary equations of state for matter, as
General Relativity does, or for arbitrary motions of charges and
dipoles, as Maxwell's electrodynamics does. To exclude the unknown
wholly as a "unified field theory" or a "world equation" purports to
do is pointless and of no scientific significance.

one not so much of direction as of degree: though all entertainment is
not art, all art must include entertainment. "Entertaining" means
interest-holding, and what bores and fails to involve has no real
artistic value. Granted, art makes demands; it entertains those who
are willing and able to feel, perceive, and think more deeply and
arduously -- more courageously if you will -- rather than those who
always want to leave their thoughts behind, most likely because
thought has abandoned them.

scorched-earth tactics in writing about a bad movie, but I rarely
write sharp criticism of actors themselves.  If they're  good in a
movie, they must have done something right.  If they're bad, it may
have been the fault of filming conditions or editing choices.  Perhaps
they may simply have been bad.  I feel reluctant to write in a hurtful
way; not always, but usually.  I feel repugnance for the critic John
Simon, who made it a speciality to attack the way actors look. They
can't help how they look, any more than John Simon can help looking

700 mph at 40,000 feet: how would such an animal feed itself?... If
you take Man as a model and test of artificial intelligence, you're
making the same mistake as the old inventors flapping their wings. You
don't realize that Mother Nature has never needed an intelligent
animal and accordingly, <em>has never bothered to develop one.</em> So
when an intelligent entity is finally built, it will have evolved on
principles different from those of Man's mind, and its level of
intelligence will certainly not be measured by the fact that it can
beat some chess champion or appear to carry on a conversation in
English.

      As life moves to this electronic frontier, politicians and
corporations are starting to exert increasing control over the new
digital realm, policing information highways with growing strictness.
Before we even realise we're there, we may find ourselves boxed into a
digital ghetto, denied simple rights of access, while corporations and
government agencies make out their territory and roam free. So who
will oppose the big guys? Who's going to stand up for our digital
civil liberties? Who has the techno-literacy necessary to ask a few
pertinent questions about what's going down in cyberspace? Perhaps the
people who have been living there the longest might have a few
answers.

      We have plenty of information technology -- what is perhaps
needed now is more intelligence technology, to help us make sense of
the growing volume of information stored in the form of statistical
data, documents, messages, and so on. For example, not many people
know that the infamous hole in the ozone layer remained undetected for
seven years as a result of infoglut. The hole had in fact been
identified by a US weather satellite in 1979, but nobody realised this
at the time because the information was buried -- along with 3 million
other unread tapes -- in the archives of the National Records Centre
in Washington DC. It was only when British scientists were analysing
the data much later in 1986 that the hole in the ozone was first
"discovered".

      And so, the best of my advice to the originators and designers
of Ada has been ignored. In this last resort, I appeal to you,
representatives of the programming profession in the United States,
and citizens concerned with the welfare and safety of your own country
and of mankind: Do not allow this language in its present state to be
used in applications where reliability is crucial, i.e., nuclear power
stations, cruise missiles, early warning systems, antiballistic
missile defense systems. The next rocket to go astray as a result of a
programming language error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a
harmless trip to Venus: it may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one
of our own cities. An unreliable programming language generating
unreliable programs constitutes a far greater risk to our environment
and to our society than unsafe cars, toxic pesticides, or accidents at
nuclear power stations. Be vigilant to reduce the risk, not to
increase it.

      Now, think about a kid in 5th grade today. They've grown up with
Nintendo and arcade-quality games on their computers. They've grown up
with zillions of utilities which typically have been polished for
years. They've grown up with operating environments that, no matter
what we may think of them, are orders of magnitude more sophisticated
and complex than what we started with. What's their motivation to
program? It's going to be years of work before their programs can
equal the quality and capability of stuff they can get just by asking.
When I started programming, I spent a lot of time writing games. Is a
kid who's used to animated 256-color action games with sound going to
bother, when the best they can do is produce some text or a few lines
moving around on the screen? And as everything moves toward GUI-ness,
that places another obstacle in their path -- the work needed to put a
GUI on something may well be beyond them, let alone actually providing
any functionality. Sometimes I wonder if we aren't the last generation
to care about the guts of the machine. We were introduced to computers
when they were simple enough that we could make them do interesting
tricks even as young children. Today, through the fruits of our own
efforts, "interesting" is a much tougher goal, and I don't know
whether our children will make it in significant numbers.

      Why do we behave like this? I believe that it is because
operating systems have had for many years the reputation of being very
difficult to write and you had better not mess with them. It's also
been policy that machines are very fast and it doesn't matter if you
execute two or three times as many instructions as necessary; by the
time you've debugged a faster version the processors will be three
times as fast as they are now anyhow. Nor does it matter (it's policy)
that over-general programs are too big. Memory's cheap. I think this
attitude is exceptionally bad. It leads to big clumsy implementations,
and, when used in a teaching environment, corrupts the minds of the

      I think that it is hard to read such material without amusement.
I feel a little admiration as well. I would never write, "It happened
one frosty look of trees waving gracefully against the wall." I almost
wish I could. Poor poets endlessly rhyme love with dove, and they are
constrained by their highly trained mediocrity never to write a good
line. In some sense, a stochastic process can do better; it at least
has a chance.

was not myth truer by the fact that it made the real story yield a

      To those accustomed to the precise, structured methods of
conventional system development, exploratory development techniques
may seem messy, inelegant, and unsatisfying. But it's a question of
congruence: precision and flexibility may be just as dysfunctional in
novel, uncertain situations as sloppiness and vacillation are in
familiar, well-defined ones. Those who admire the massive, rigid bone

      If you want to write software that's fast or portable or well
structured, despite years of evolution, you have to care about it and
put effort into it. It's easy to be sloppy, but it comes back to haunt
you. The only way to make something fast is to care about performance
from the beginning and put real effort into getting it. The only way
to keep the code clean and maintainable is to constantly put effort
into that aspect of it. Resist the temptation to make quick fixes. Or
if a quick fix just has to be done for some reason, make a point of
going back and doing it right. These things do not happen
automatically and they won't happen if you don't care about them. The
main reason why a lot of software today is bloated and complicated and
obscure and buggy is that people don't care. They may care in the
sense that if you ask them they say, "Yes, we care," but the fact is
they don't put any effort into it. They don't care enough to work on
it.

treasures of one period to the generations that follow; and laden with
this, their precious freight, they sail safely across gulfs of time in
which empires have suffered shipwreck and the languages of common life
have sunk into oblivion.

  Every culture faces the same fundamental challenges.  Men and women
  come together, children are brought into the world, nurtured and
  sheltered; elders are led into the realm of death as fearlessly as
  the imagination allows. To be human is to know the terror and
  splendour of a night sky, the crush of storms, the blood cries of
  enemies sweeping in with the dawn.   Such is our common experience.
  To bring order to chaos, sense to sensation, we have created rules,
  which cross-culturally are remarkable in their consistency. ... Yet
  within this common fabric, this cloak of humanity, lie the
  individual threads of specific and highly specialized ways of life,
  distinct cultures, each with its unique and wondrous dream of the
  Earth.  Unravelling the cloth and holding the strands to the light
  is the practice and contribution of ethnography.

      I don't believe anyone can enjoy living in this world unless he
can accept its imperfection. He must know and admit that he is
imperfect, that all other mortals are imperfect, that it is childish
to allow these imperfections to destroy all his hope and all his
desire to live. Nature is older than man, and she is still far from
perfect. Her summers do not always start promptly on June 21. Her bugs
and beetles and other insects often go beyond her obvious intentions,
devouring the leaves and buds with which she has adorned her
countryside. After the land has remained too dry for too long, she
sends relieving rains. But frequently they come in torrents so violent
that they do more harm than good. Over the years, however, nature
keeps going on in her imperfect way, and the result -- in spite of her
many mistakes -- is a continuing miracle. It would be folly for an
individual to seek to do better -- to do better than to go on in his
own imperfect way, making his mistakes, riding out the rough and
bewildering, exciting and beautiful storm of life until the day he
dies.

of people who know how marginal, how fragile, how finite their lives

this knowledge, even a sense of strange comfort, because they know

fearfulness that he saw how the books stretched away into the
darkness. They seemed to expand as soon as they reached the shadows,
creating some dark world where there was no beginning and no end, no
story, no meaning. And if you crossed the threshold into that world,
you would be surrounded by words; you would crush them beneath your
feet, you would knock against them with your head and arms, but if you
tried to grasp them they would melt away. Philip did not dare turn his

years, gathered up its halters, thumbscrews, and firebrands, and set

      I do not suppose that a Man loses his Time, who is not engaged
in publick Affairs, or in an illustrious Course of Action. On the
contrary, I believe our Hours may very often be more profitably laid
out in such Transactions as make no Figure in the World, than in such
as are apt to draw upon them the Attention of Mankind. One may become
wiser and better by several Methods of Employing one's self in Secrecy
and Silence, and do what is laudable without Noise or Ostentation.

      No matter what we choose to say of it, Canada is a whole series
of accidents. If it should expire in its present form the world would
survive and so, almost certainly, would Canada's separate parts. I

Canada withdraw from Quebec. ... Yet it's been a lovely place to grow

      Don't you know that love isn't just going to bed? Love isn't an
act, it's a whole life. It's staying with her now because she needs
you; it's knowing you and she will still care about each other when
sex and daydreams, fights and futures -- when all that's on the shelf
and done with. Love -- why, I'll tell you what love is: it's you at
seventy-five and her at seventy-one, each of you listening for the
other's step in the next room, each afraid that a sudden silence, a
sudden cry, could mean a lifetime's talk is over.

      So, if this were indeed my Final Hour, these would be my words
to you. I would not claim to pass on any secret of life, for there is
none, or any wisdom except the passionate plea of caring ... Try to
feel, in your heart's core, the reality of others. This is the most
painful thing in the world, probably, and the most necessary. In times
of personal adversity, know that you are not alone. Know that although
in the eternal scheme of things you are small, you are also unique and

world. Know that your commitment is above all to life itself.

the only way to achieve an important practical result. Some of them

    <p>
      What men, in their imbecility, constantly mistake for a
deficiency of intelligence in women is merely an incapacity for
mastering small and trivial tricks. A man thinks that he is more
intelligent than his wife because he can add up figures more
accurately and because he understands the lingo of the stock market,
and follows the doings of political mountebanks, and knows the
minutiae of some sordid and degrading business or profession, say soap
selling or the law. But these puerile talents are not really signs of
intelligence; they are merely accomplishments, and they differ only in
degree from the accomplishments of a trained chimpanzee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that the capacity for mastering them is the sign of
a petty mind, and Havelock Ellis, in his great study of English
genius, shows that men of genius almost invariably lack it. One could
not think of Shakespeare or Goethe or Beethoven multiplying 3,456,754
by 79,999 without making a mistake, nor could one think of them
remembering the price of this or that stock last July, or the number
of beans in a pound, or the freight rate on steel beams from Akron,
Ohio, to Newport News, or concerning themselves about the cost of
producing a stick of chewing gum, or the pay of street car conductors,
or the credit of some obscure shopkeeper in Memphis, Tenn. Such
idiotic concerns are beneath the dignity of first-rate minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      That women always try to evade them -- that they have little
capacity for the childish complexity of tricks upon which men base
their so-called business and professional skill and cunning -- this is
but one more proof of their intellectual aristocracy. They are not
stumped by such enterprises because they are difficult, but because
they are trivial.

      When I left my boxed township of Illinois farmland to attend my
dad's alma mater in the lurid jutting Berkshires of western
Massachusetts, I all of a sudden developed a jones for mathematics.
I'm starting to see why this was so. College math evokes and catharts
a Midwesterner's sickness for home. I'd grown up inside vectors, lines
and lines athwart lines, grids -- and, on the scale of horizons, broad
curving lines of geographic force, the weird topographical drain-swirl
of a whole lot of ice-ironed land that sits and spins atop plates. The
area behind and below these broad curves at the seam of land and sky I
could plot by eye way before I came to know infinitesimals as
easements, an integral as schema. Math at a hilly Eastern school was
like waking up; it dismantled memory and put it in light. Calculus
was, quite literally, child's play.

      It is in the power of everybody, with a little courage, to hold
out a hand to someone different, to listen, and to attempt to
increase, even by a tiny amount, the quantity of kindness and humanity
in the world. But it is careless to do so without remembering how
previous efforts have failed, and how it has never been possible to
predict for certain how a human being will behave. History, with its
endless procession of passers-by, most of whose encounters have been
missed opportunities, has so far been largely a chronicle of ability
gone to waste. But next time two people meet, the result could be
different. That is the origin of anxiety, but also of hope, and hope
is the origin of humanity.

we're not interested in preserving value or making profits, and as for
the choice between one thing and another, when you live for many
hundreds of years, you know that every opportunity will come again. We
have different needs. You have to repair your balloon and keep it in
good condition, and that takes time and trouble, I see that; but for
us to fly, all we have to do is tear off a branch of cloud-pine; any
will do, and there are plenty more. We don't feel cold, so we need no
warm clothes. We have no means of exchange apart from mutual aid. If a
witch needs something, another witch will give it to her. If there is
a war to be fought, we don't consider cost one of the factors in
deciding whether or not it is right to fight. Nor do we have any
notion of honour, as bears do, for instance. An insult to a bear is a
deadly thing. To us... inconceivable. How could you insult a witch?

establish a character for virtue; elaborate repartees, so that he may
pass for a wit; steal from other authors, and put down the theft to

feign originality? affect benevolence or misanthropy? appeal to the

      <foreign>Horas non numero nisi serenas</foreign> -- is the motto
of a sun-dial near Venice. There is a softness and a harmony in the
words and in the thought unparalleled. Of all conceits it is surely
the most classical. "I count only the hours that are serene." What a
bland and care-dispelling feeling! How the shadows seem to fade on the
dial-plate as the sky lours, and time presents only a blank unless as
its progress is marked by what is joyous, and all that is not happy
sinks into oblivion! What a fine lesson is conveyed to the mind -- to
take no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles
and neglect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and
gentle moments, turning always to the sunny side of things, and
letting the rest slip for our imaginations, unheeded or forgotten! How

      One of the surest of tests is the way in which a poet borrows.
Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they
take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least
something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of
feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was
torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion.

      And now, I feel myself becoming impatient with Olmsted. Why
can't he just get on with it? We expect the lives of people --
especially people who achieve great things -- to neatly follow a grand
design. I think of Michelangelo or Mozart or Cézanne. Their lives
resemble a game of building blocks. The blocks at the bottom are
arranged first and not haphazardly, since they will support the upper
levels. As the construction progresses, and more blocks are added, the
structure gets taller and taller. It is carefully assembled so as not
to topple. Following Olmsted's life is more like putting together a
picture puzzle. All sorts of odd-shaped pieces are lying on the table.
Two or three form a bit of sky, others a fragment of foliage. Here is
something that might -- or might not -- be water. It's not yet clear
how these fragments come together. Some pieces don't seem to fit
anywhere. Yet all the pieces of the jigsaw are necessary. Only when
the last piece is in place -- when the puzzle is complete -- does the
design make itself evident.

      Whenever I do things because I want to do it and because it
seems fun or interesting and so on and so forth, it almost always
works. And it almost always winds up more than paying for itself.
Whenever I do things for the money, not only does it prove a headache
and a pain in the neck and come with all sorts of awful things
attached, but I normally don't wind up getting the money, either. So,
after a while, you do sort of start to learn [to] just forget about
the things where people come to you and dangle huge wads of cash in
front of you. Go for the one that seems interesting because, even if
it all falls apart, you've got something interesting out of it.
Whereas, the other way, you normally wind up getting absolutely
nothing out of it.

      It is one of the many graveyards which are the Great War's chief
heritage. The chronicle of its battles provides the dreariest
literature in military history; no brave trumpets sound in memory for
the drab millions who plodded to death on the featureless plains of
Picardy and Poland; no litanies are sung for the leaders who coaxed
them to slaughter. The legacy of the war's political outcome scarcely
bears contemplation: Europe ruined as a centre of world civilisation,
Christian kingdoms transformed through defeat into godless tyrannies,
Bolshevik or Nazi, the superficial difference in their ideology
counting not at all in their cruelty to common and decent folk. All
that was worst in the century which the First World War had opened,
the deliberate starvation of peasant enemies of the people by
provinces, the extermination of racial outcasts, the persecution of
ideology's intellectual and cultural hate-objects, the massacre of
ethnic minorities, the extinction of small national sovereignties, the
destruction of parliaments and the elevation of commissars, gauleiters
and warlords to power over voiceless millions, had its origins in the
chaos it left behind.

dreams and evil spirits, our vices and our forgotten and unexpiated

restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story
seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel
uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been
salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of
a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There
is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true

      The undercurrent of raw sexuality in my movies is not a theme --
it's just an approach. For me, the human body is the first fact of
human existence. I'm an atheist. I don't believe in an afterlife. To
me, our bodily reality is often avoided -- a lot of art, religion,
politics, and culture seek to make us avoid our existential reality.
And I insist on it. ... I'm not looking to transcend the body, but to
delve into it. Profoundly.

      If the Trail of Tears is a glacier that inched its way west, my
uncle is one of the boulders it deposited when it stopped. He had to
work the farm, and the farm he worked was what was left of his
grandfather's Indian allotment. And then came the Dust Bowl, and then
came the war. All these historical forces bore down on him, but he did
not break. Still, compared to him, compared to the people we descend
from, I am free of history. I'm so free of history I have to get in a
car and drive seven states to find it.

      My personal experience has not been that traveling around the
country is broadening or relaxing, or that radical changes in place
and context have a salutary effect, but rather that intranational
tourism is radically constricting and humbling in the hardest way --
hostile to my fantasy of being a true individual, of living somehow
outside and above it all. (Coming up is the part that my companions
find especially unhappy and repellent, a sure way to spoil the fun of
vacation travel.) To be a mass tourist, for me, is to become a pure
late-date American: alien, ignorant, greedy for something you cannot
ever have, disappointed in a way you can never admit. It is to spoil,
by way of sheer ontology, the very unspoiledness you are there to
experience. It is to impose yourself on places that in all noneconomic
ways would be better, realer, without you. It is, in lines and
gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of
yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: as a tourist, you
become economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect
on a dead thing.

      In his review of "Breaking the Spell," Leon Wieseltier couldn't
resist the reflexive accusation that building a worldview on a
scientific base is reductive, and as is often the case, he trotted out
the existence of art to capture our sympathies. As a composer, I am
weary of being commandeered as evidence of supernatural forces. Unlike
Wieseltier, I do not find it difficult to "envisage the biological
utilities" of the "Missa Solemnis"; it merely requires a chain with

      I left the flat depressed but, as I walked down Espedair Street,
back into town under a glorious sunset of red and gold, slowly a
feeling of contentment, intensifying almost to elation, filled me. I
couldn't say why; it felt like more than having gone through a period
of mourning and come out the other side, and more than just having
reassessed my own woes and decided they were slight compared to what
some people had to bear; it felt like faith, like revelation: that
things went on, that life ground on regardless, and mindless, and
produced pain and pleasure and hope and fear and joy and despair, and
you dodged some of it and you sought some of it and sometimes you were
lucky and sometimes you weren't, and sometimes you could plan your way
ahead and that would be the right thing to have done, but other times
all you could do was forget about plans and just be ready to
<em>react</em>, and sometimes the obvious was true and sometimes it
wasn't, and sometimes experience helped but not always, and it was all
luck, fate, in the end; you lived, and you waited to see what
happened, and you would rarely ever be sure that what you had done was
really the right thing or the wrong thing, because things can always
be better, and things can always be worse.

      His love of each particular experiment, and his eager zeal not
to lose the fruit of it, came out markedly in these crossing
experiments -- in the elaborate care he took not to make any confusion
in putting capsules into wrong trays, &amp;c, &amp;c. I can recall his
appearance as he counted seeds under the simple microscope with an
alertness not usually characterising such mechanical work as counting.
I think he personified each seed as a small demon trying to elude him
by getting into the wrong heap, or jumping away altogether, and this
gave to the work the excitement of a game.

      The Germany that was "my country" and the country of those like
me was not just a blob on the map of Europe. It was characterized by
certain distinctive attitudes: humanity, openness on all sides,
philosophical depth of thought, dissatisfaction with the world and
oneself, the courage always to try something fresh and to abandon it
if need be, self-criticism, truthfulness, objectivity, severity,
rigor, variety, a certain ponderousness but also delight in the freest
improvisation, caution and earnestness but also a playful richness of
invention, engendering ever new ideas that it quickly rejects as
invalid, respect for originality, good nature, generosity,
sentimentality, musicality, and above all freedom, something roving,
unfettered, soaring, weightless, Promethean. Secretly we were proud
that in the realm of the spirit our country was the land of unlimited
possibilities. Be that as it may, this was the country we felt
attached to, in which we were at home.

fact -- and all its consequences.

      All we really have are words, preserved for us in the most
haphazard fashion out of a much larger body of literature. So the
study of ancient history is roughly analogous to scrutinizing a badly
decayed patchwork quilt, full of holes and scraps of material from
earlier work. Central to understanding the process of study is an
awareness that, besides an occasional fragment liberated from the
desert by archaeologists, there will be no more evidence. The quilt is
it; everything must be based on a reasoned analysis of the fabric at
hand. Plainly the quality and integrity of some of the patches greatly
exceed those of the others, so they will be emphasized and relied upon
whenver possible. Yet, because of the limited nature of the material,
there is always the temptation to fall back on a truly outlandish
polka dot or a monumentally garish plaid, if only to figure out where
it came from and what it might have meant in its original form. In the
end, even among otherwise tasteful and scrupulous ancient historians,
something is almost always better than nothing.

      This is a book that contradicts itself a hundred times; but that
is not a criticism of it, because its author thinks contradictions are
a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This is a book that
systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is
not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations
are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her
facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of
vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin
sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a
criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken
lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech
is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor. This is a book that
clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before
it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; but that is not a
criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and
refreshing to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy
minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it,
because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author
would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short,
this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate
products of art.

  many of the government’s lumbering, error-prone efforts at
  regulation. These processes are cumbersome, often wasteful, and
  inevitably infuriating. But at their best they have the virtue of
  occurring in a common arena, the place where all parts of a population
  meet. They force us, if we hope to get anything done, to translate our
  values and thoughts into language that communicates broadly. The more

It's a question of what kind of place you're born into, not just
geographically or socioeconomically, but historically.  There are
lucky times and places to be born, and unlucky times and places.
In America, the relatively lucky time for the average person to be
born appears to be past.

<quotation date="1135"><p>Let us, however, think about what has become of
those who lived in the first millennium around this time, around the
135th year.  In those days, of course, Antoninus ruled Rome with his
brother Lucius Aurelius, and Pius the Roman was pope. ...  But who
were the other people who lived throughout the countries of the world
at that time?  Let our present kings and dukes, tyrants and princes,
church leaders and earls, commanders and governors, magistrates and
sheriffs, warlike and strong men -- let them tell me: who were in
command and held office at that time?  ...  What does it matter
whether they were individually noble or ignoble, renowned or unknown,
praiseworthy or disreputable, exalted or cast down, wise or foolish?
If any of them undertook some labor for the sake of praise and glory,
when now no record of him survives any more than of his horse or his
ass, why then did the wretch torment his spirit in vain?  What benefit
was it to them, who came to this?

<quotation date="2018"><p>
  The lingering nineteenth-century belief that Earth changes only
  slowly has lulled us into thinking that it is impassive and eternal,
  that nothing we do could alter it significantly.  That notion has
  also caused us to view Earth's intermittent adjustments -- the
  creation of a new volcanic island, a magnitude 9 earthquake -- as
  aberrations, when in fact these events are business as usual for the
  planet. We are big enough now to scratch and dent the Earth, scar,
  and abrade it, but we ourselves will have to live with the
  damage. Earth, meanwhile, will continue to make slow repairs,
  punctuated by sudden renovation projects that will clear away our
  proudest constructions.

  When we thought of language as a book, we thought of it as static
  and authoritative, a thing which would be better if we returned to a
  pristine first edition and erased all the messy new words that
  people had scribbled into the margins.  But there is no pristine
  first edition of a network.  A network is not debased as it changes;
  its flexibility is a key part of its strength. So, too, is language
  enriched and made alive again for each subsequent generation as new
  connections grow and old ones wither away.

      The clarity of Socrates' situation is remarkable. ... his exit
is wonderfully seductive. It is calm, clear, convincing. Friends are
present, wise words are said, the ethical unfolding of life is tied up
in a neat package. And then he slips away, slowly becoming stone-cold
from the feet up. It is our fantasy of the normal death, with the
addition of social and prophetic implications, to say nothing of
heroic proportions. Again, most of us will likely drop dead on a
subway platform, in the middle of an orgasm or straining on a toilet
seat early in the morning. The real tragedy of death may be just how
often it is comic.

I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is
nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as
much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content
before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. What I am
grateful for is the gift of intelligence, and for life, love, wonder,
and laughter. You can't say it wasn't interesting. My lifetime's
memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require
them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel
Tower I brought home from Paris.

Most of the harm done in the world is out of stupidity, not by design.
Be on the watch for skulduggery... but don't fall into the trap of
thinking that every evil thing that occurs in the world in part of
some diabolic master plan. The notion that whatever is wrong with the
world can be blamed on somebody (never, of course, one's self) is a
rather infantile carryover from the childhood days when our parents
were thought to be all-powerful and therefore all-responsible.

      As I walked out to the plane in the balmy air of a Sydney
September night, my mind flew back to the dusty cemetery where my
father was buried. Where, I wondered, would my bones come to rest? It
pained me to think of them not fertilizing Australian soil. Then I
comforted myself with the notion that wherever on the earth was my
final resting place, my body would return to the restless red dust of
the western plains. I could see how it would blow about and get in
people's eyes, and I was content with that.

      The principle of maximum diversity operates both at the physical
and at the mental level. It says that the laws of nature and the
initial conditions are such as to make the universe as interesting as
possible. As a result, life is possible but not too easy. Always when
things are dull, something new turns up to challenge us and to stop us
from settling into a rut. Examples of things which make life difficult
are all around us: comet impacts, ice ages, weapons, plagues, nuclear
fission, computers, sex, sin and death. Not all challenges can be
overcome, and so we have tragedy. Maximum diversity often leads to
maximum stress. In the end we survive, but only by the skin of our
teeth.

      There are men who serve us, like the consul at Trollesund. And
there are men we take for lovers or husbands. You are so young, Lyra,
too young to understand this, but I shall tell you anyway and you'll
understand it later: men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies,
creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud,
beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that
our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their children,
who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the
blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too.
When a little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother
knows he isn't. Each time becomes more painful, until finally your
heart is broken. Perhaps that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is
older than the tundra. Perhaps, for her, witches' lives are as brief
as men's are to us.
