    "There is good, and there is evil.  I left Gallifrey to answer a question of my own.  By any analysis, evil should always win.  Good is not a practical survival strategy.  It requires loyalty, self-sacrifice, and love.  So, why  does good prevail?  What keeps the balance between good and evil in this appalling universe?  Is there some kind of logic?  Some mysterious force?"

    I adjusted the time frame, only by a couple of hours.  Any other
    day, it wouldn't make any difference.  but this is Christmas 1914
    and the human miracle is about to happen.  The Christmas
    armistice...
    It never happened again.  Any war, anywhere.  But for one day, one
    Christmas, a very long time ago, everyone just put down their
    weapons and started to sing.  Everybody just stopped.
    Everyone... was just kind.

    A life this long -- do you understand what it is?  It's a battlefield, like this one. &lt;gestures&gt;  And it's empty.  Because everyone else has fallen.
