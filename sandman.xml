      The process was slow at first, my lord. Things in the dreamworld
began to transmute. I was aware of it in my library... Slowly, the
words began to fade. Some time after you vanished, my books became
bound volumes of blank paper. The next day the whole library was gone.
I never found it again...

seems less like an act of creation than one of sculpture: as if he
were already waiting, grave and patient, inside a block of white
marble, and all I needed to do was chip away everything that wasn't
him.

      There is another version of the tale. That is the tale the women
tell each other, in their private language that the men-children are
not taught, and that the old men are too wise to learn. And in that
version of the tale perhaps things happened differently. But then,
that is a women's tale, and it is never told to men.

Destiny's garden, you make a choice; and every choice determines
future paths. However, at the end of a lifetime of walking you might

ahead, and see only darkness.

      Never a possession, always the possessor, with skin as pale as
smoke, and eyes tawny and sharp as yellow wine: Desire is everything
you have ever wanted. Whoever you are. Whatever you are.
<em>Everything</em>.

      Despair, Desire's sister and twin, is queen of her own bleak
bourne. It is said that scattered through Despair's domain are a
multitude of tiny windows, hanging in the void. Each window looks out
onto a different scene, being, in our world, a mirror. Sometimes you
will look into a mirror and feel the eyes of Despair upon you, feel
her hook catch and snag on your heart.

      For Delirium was once Delight. And although that was long ago
now, even today her eyes are badly matched; one eye is a vivid emerald
green, spattered with silver flecks that move; her other eye is vein
blue. Who knows what Delirium sees, through her mismatched eyes?

      "You know you can kill, my brother, when the Dreaming is
endangered. And it has never been more endangered than now. How much
longer will you wait? Until the stars go mad? The nebulae? The
Universe?"

      "It is wrong. I was not made to kill innocents."

      "Everybody kills, little brother. They even kill their dreams.
And you have waited too long."

    <p>
      If we kill you, another aspect of yourself will take your place.
That is what I learned at the congress at the dawn of time. So we will
not kill you, dream king. We will simply render you unavailable.
Inside the event horizon of a dark star, nothing ever gets out. No
light, no information. And definitely no dreams. Goodnight.

    <p>
      I am trapped inside a black hole. I am removed from the worlds.
I reach out with my mind and I touch nothing and no one: no dreaming
minds, no pictures, no emotions, no thought, no life... Time is
dissolved in the darkness. I am a child of Time and Night, and this
place will prove my end.

      We have only the slightest chance, but that is enough. ...
Because we cannot do this alone. Yes. Because once the world belonged
to the cats. Because you allowed it to change. Because it is the
nature of Dreams, and <em>only</em> of Dreams, to define Reality.
Destiny is bound to existence. Death is limited by what she will or
will not accept.
